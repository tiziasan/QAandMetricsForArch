# Quality Metrics in Software Architecture

**Paper Title**: Quality Metrics in Software Architecture

**Submitted to**: 20th IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA 2023)

**Abstract**: The importance of software architecture is largely recognized also in iterative and agile development settings. However, it is quite complex to provide evidence that the architecture is of good quality and that the architectural decisions are appropriate, correct, or optimal. Architecture evaluation aims at showing and providing confidence that design decisions contribute to fulfilling the stakeholder concerns. Some architecture evaluation methods are scenario-based and aim at balancing many potentially conflicting quality attributes. Other works focus on a specific quality attribute and provide metrics to automatically measure it. We focus here on the last group of works.


Specifically, this paper aims at surveying the state of the art to identify metrics that have been proposed for evaluating architectures. The elicited metrics are organized into categories and associated with the specific quality attributes they aim to measure. We contribute also an MDE framework that generates web views facilitating the analysis and open contribution to our repository of metrics, quality attributes, and quality characteristics. 
In this way, researchers and practitioners can easily retrieve the metrics that are appropriate to their specific needs.
