# Metrics and Quality Attributes in Software Architecture

<p align="justify"> To put into practice the results we found during our research and keep the results up-to-date we propose a framework that generates informative and aggregated web views of the metrics, quality attributes, quality characteristics, and their relationships. The proposed framework has been implemented with MDE techniques and it is based on a metamodel which allows us to define the quality characteristics, quality attributes, and metrics to measure the quality attributes. </p>



<p align="justify">Based on this framework we have implemented a Domain Specific Language (DSL) with xText allowing the textual definition for our quality repository. Indeed, this DSL is based on a grammar (derived from the metamodel), allowing software architects, practitioners, and researchers to define quality aspects and their relationships. Moreover, we have integrated rules inspired by the <a href="https://slebok.github.io/zoo/markup/textual/bibtex/bibtex/hillairet/extracted/index.html">Bibtex grammar</a> to allow contributors to directly work with bibtex entries in the DSL, to define research contributions. By using this DSL, contributors can define their own quality attributes and metrics and/or refine those provided by us (we call the file containing these definitions as "quality definition file").</p>

## Step by step guide to install the DSL

### Pre-requisites:

* You should have the latest version of Eclipse IDE installed on your machine (in case you don’t have it download and install it from [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)).

* <p align="justify">Install and Configure a web-server (e.g., MAMP). This web server allows you to get web views of generated quality characteristics, attributes, and metrics which are browsable in the online version.</p>


### Steps:
* Download and install the xText plugin into a running Eclipse (Please refer to this [link](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/download.html) for  more instructions).
  * Step 1) Eclipse Help > Eclipse Marketplace
  * Step 2) Install the plugin “Eclipse xText"
  * Step 3) Restart Eclipse

* Download the plugins files located in the plugins folder and import them into eclipse.
* <p align="justify">Run the configuration (upon running the configuration Eclipse will automatically open another Eclipse instance which means that you will have two Eclipse instances running).</p>

* In another Eclipse instance create a new project, specify a project name and specify the location where you want to save your project.

* <p align="justify">Since we want a visual preview of the results that are browsable in the online version, we need to point to the location of our project using the web server's path. Untick “User default Location” and set the path pointing to the path of your web server.</p>

* <p align="justify">Download the quality definition file called "repo.archquality" which is located in the “catalog” folder and paste it into the project you have created. The quality definition file is associated with the .archquality extension, which will make sure that the Eclipse editor recognizes the content of the model instantiation. By using the provided editor, all the developed features will be available, e.g., syntax highlighting, code completion, error quick fixes, etc. as can be seen in this screenshot.</p>

* Every time the .archquality is updated, a code generation step is also executed. You will see a "src-gen" folder generated automatically in your project folder.

* <p align="justify">The web views are generated by an xTend code generator processing the .archquality model and are updated every time a merge of the quality definition is executed. Once everything is installed correctly, go to your browser then type the address of your web-server where the generated folder is located and the generated web views similar to this one will be shown.</p>

## How to contibute to this framework

<p align="justify">Following the process, a contributor who wants to define new quality attributes and/or metrics or new relationships discovered in his/her studies can create a branch of the repository, even if the only file needed is the .archquality definition (up-to-date in the catalog folder). Contributors can then add or edit existing definitions by exploiting the textual syntax. After that, a contributor can emit a pull request that will be evaluated by the repository maintainer and in case the provided changes in definitions are legit and supported by the correct linked research contributions, a merge of the .archquality model will be executed.</p> 


### Contribution process of the proposed framework.
<p align="justify">This guide provides a brief explanation of how to contribute to the catalog explored
in the previous sections.</p>
